### Project Description
A Site that lets you play a game where the camera is used to identify whether an object is red or blue but with a twist.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The problem is how to waste time efficently.

### Project Demo
# Video

In the video , We enter the fake game through the main initiate system button and plays the game which only increments blue counter then we terminates the game , returns to home and finds the real button , finally directing us to the original game.

# Additional Demos
[Add any extra demo materials/links]
